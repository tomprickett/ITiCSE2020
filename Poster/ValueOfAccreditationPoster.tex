\begin{abstract}
This poster presents a model for the value provided by professional
body accreditation of computer science degree programmes in the United
Kingdom (UK). We introduce how one large UK professional computing
body -- BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT -- addresses degree
accreditation, as well as recent changes to content and process. Whilst
comparable accreditation regimes exist in a number of other
jurisdictions, we provide the opportunity for exploring future
extensions to, and the portability of, the UK model.

\section*{The Model}

The value of professional body degree accreditation regimes as a
kite-marking exercise (or to support a globally-portable and
recognised workforce) remains high~\cite{Knight_2015}. Equally, the
respective national (or otherwise) regimes are criticised for being
perceived to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and potentially
constraining innovation in learning and teaching~\cite{Harvey2004};
generating revenues streams in their own right rather than for the
benefit of a discipline or wider society~\cite{Knight_2015}; or
colonial and paternalistic in nature~\cite{Mutereko2017}.  The model
presented in this poster was generated by insights obtained from the
views of UK higher education institutions (HEIs) through a range of
formal and informal events organised by BCS, The Chartered Institute
for IT: canvassed as part of 18 formal accreditation visits (from
September 2018-September 2019); workshops run between November 2018
and November 2019 as part of the operation of BCS Academic
Accreditation Committee (AAC); and survey-based feedback gained from
BCS Academic Assessors, attendees of the 2020 ACM Computing Education
Practice Conference in Durham, UK~\cite{CrickEtAl2020Cep} and the
readership of ITNow~\cite{CrickEtAl2020ITNow}, the `the voice of the
BCS' which publishes articles on all aspects of computing and IT.  The
proposed model represents a commitment to continuously review and
enhance practices in response to criticism (e.g. by removing
bureaucracy, further supporting graduate employment, etc.) and to
enhance the overall value provided. The following are aspects of the
current value to accredited HEIs.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item {Raising output standards, essentially performing a
kite-marking function.}
	\item {Employ internationally-recognised standards and
memoranda (e.g. Seoul Accord, Washington Accord, EQANIE) to
promote the global parity of computer science education and hence the
mobility of graduates.}
	\item {Ensuring curricula relevance e.g. coverage of
cybersecurity~\cite{Cricketal2019}, team working and professional
environment}
	\item {Identifying and disseminating practice highlights
either directly \cite{practice_highlights_2020} or via other means
such as conferences (e.g. ACM CEP Conference~\cite{CrickEtAl2020Cep}} )
	\item {Industry relevance by mandating the inclusion of
industrialist upon accreditation panels}
	\item {Accrediting work experience in degree programmes.}
        \end{compactitem}

\section*{Future Work}
        
The feedback to date indicates that generic criticisms of professional
body accreditation regimes not withstanding, the developed model is
broadly accepted in the UK jurisdiction. The next step is to explore
the portability and compare the applicability of this model to other
jurisdictions.
