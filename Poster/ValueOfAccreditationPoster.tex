\begin{abstract}
This poster presents a model for the value provided by professional
body accreditation of computer science degree programmes in the United
Kingdom (UK). We introduce how one large UK professional computing
body -- BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT (BCS)-- addresses degree
accreditation, as well as recent changes to content and process. Whilst
comparable accreditation regimes exist in a number of other
jurisdictions, we provide the opportunity for exploring future
extensions to, and the portability of, the UK model.

%\section*{The Model}

\textbf{ Background Research.} The value of professional body degree accreditation regimes as a
kite-marking exercise (or to support a globally-portable and
recognised workforce) remains high~\cite{Knight_2015}. Equally, the
respective national (or otherwise) regimes are criticised as: being unnecessarily bureaucratic and  
constraining innovation ~\cite{Harvey2004};
generating revenues streams in their own right rather than for the
benefit of a discipline or wider society~\cite{Knight_2015}; or
colonial and paternalistic in nature~\cite{Mutereko2017}. The value provided by one such accreditation (BCS) regime was assessed by the views of UK higher education institutions (HEIs) by: canvassing as part of 18 formal accreditation visits (from
September 2018-September 2019); workshops run between November 2018
and November 2019 as part of the operation of BCS Academic
Accreditation Committee (AAC); and survey-based feedback gained from
BCS Academic Assessors, attendees of the 2020 ACM Computing Education
Practice Conference~\cite{CrickEtAl2020Cep} and the
readership of ITNow~\cite{CrickEtAl2020ITNow}, the `the voice of the
BCS' which publishes articles on all aspects of computing and IT.  

\textbf{The Proposed Model}   The following are the value of accreditation: Raising output standards, essentially performing a
		kite-marking function; employ internationally-recognised standards and
		memoranda (e.g. Seoul Accord, Washington Accord, EQANIE) to
		promote the global parity of computer science education and the
		mobility of graduates;	ensuring curricula relevance e.g. coverage of
		cybersecurity~\cite{Cricketal2019}, team working and professional
		environment;
	identifying and disseminating practice highlights
		either directly \cite{practice_highlights_2020} or by other means ~\cite{CrickEtAl2020Cep}
	; promoting Industry relevant curricula; 
	 accrediting work experience in degree programmes; and responding to criticism (reduce administrative burden, promote innovation, etc).
	 Generic criticisms of professional body accreditation regimes not withstanding, the feedback to date is broadly supportive of the proposed model.


%\section*{Future Work}

\textbf{Future Work.} The next step is to compare and contrasts the model to that used in other jurisdictions and assess portability. The value of accreditation is linked to the value of membership and registration with a professional body, the enhancement of this value to students, graduates, early career professionals and academics is currently being explored by the BCS.
